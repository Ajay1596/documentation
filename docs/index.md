Welcome to MOSIP's documentation!
=======================================

The Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP) helps Governments and other user organizations implement a digital, foundational identity system. Nations can use MOSIP freely as a core to build their own identity systems. Being modular in its architecture, MOSIP provides flexibility to countries in how they implement and configure their systems, and helps avoid vendor lock-in.  Anchored at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore (IIIT-B), MOSIP harnesses the power of open source and embraces the best practices of scalability, security and privacy.
