Welcome to MOSIP's documentation!
=======================================

The Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP) helps Governments and other user organizations implement a digital, foundational identity system. Nations can use MOSIP freely as a core to build their own identity systems. Being modular in its architecture, MOSIP provides flexibility to countries in how they implement and configure their systems, and helps avoid vendor lock-in.  Anchored at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore (IIIT-B), MOSIP harnesses the power of open source and embraces the best practices of scalability, security and privacy.

MOSIP provides the following basic features:

* acquire an individual's identity data
* process the identity data to establish uniqueness
* generate a Unique Identity Number (UIN)
* authenticate an individual's identity where required to provide access to services such as healthcare, education, social security etc.
