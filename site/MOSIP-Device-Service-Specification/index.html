<h2 id="3-device-specification">3. Device Specification</h2>
<p>The MOSIP device specification provides compliance guidelines to devices for them to work with MOSIP. The compliance is based on device capability, trust and communication protocols. A MOSIP compliant device would follow the standards established in this document. It is expected that the devices are compliant to this specification and tested and validated. The details of each of these are outlined in the subsequent sections.</p>
<p><strong>Device Capability:</strong>
The MOSIP compliant device is expected to perform the following:
<em>   Should have the ability to collect one or more biometric
</em>   Should have the ability to sign the captured biometric image or template.
<em>   Should have the ability to protect secret keys
</em>   Should have no mechanism to inject the biometric</p>

<h2 id="4-device-trust">4. Device Trust</h2>
<p>MOSIP compliant devices provide a trust environment for the devices to be used in registration, KYC and auth scenarios. The trust level is established based on the device support for trusted execution.</p>
<h3 id="foundational-trust-module-ftm">Foundational Trust Module (FTM):</h3>
<p>The foundational trust module would be created using a secure microprocessor capable of performing all required biometric processing and secure storage of keys. The foundational device trust would satisfy the below requirements.
1. The module has the ability to securely generate, store and process cryptographic keys.
2. Generation of asymmetric keys and symmetric keys in random.
3. The module has the ability to protect keys from extraction.
4. The module has to protect the keys from physical tampering, temperature, frequency and voltage related attacks.
5. The module has the ability to perform a cryptographically validatable secure boot.
6. The module has the ability to run trusted applications.
The foundational device trust derived from this module is used to enable trust-based computing for biometric capture.
The foundational device trust module provides for a trusted execution environment based on the following.
1. Secure Boot
    1. Ability to cryptographically verify code before execution.
    2. Ability to check for integrity violation of the module/device
    3. Halt upon failure.
    4. Ability to securely upgrade and perform forward only upgrades, to thwart downgrade attacks. 
1. Secure application
    1. Ability to run applications that are trusted.
    2. Protect against downgrading of applications.</p>
<p><strong>Foundational Trust Module Identity:</strong></p>
<p>The foundational module upon its first boot is expected to generate a random asymmetric key pair and provide the public part of the key to obtain a valid certificate. The entire certificate issuance would be in a secured provisioning facility. The certificate issued to the module will have a defined validity period as per the MOSIP certificate policy document defined by the MOSIP adopters.</p>
<p><strong>Device Identity:</strong></p>
<p>As MOSIP deals with biometrics it is imperative that all devices that connect to MOSIP are identifiable. MOSIP believes in cryptographic Identity as its basis for trust.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Id:</strong> An identification mark that shows MOSIP compliance and a readable unique device serial number (minimum of 12 digits), make and model. The same information has to be available over a 2D QR Code or Barcode.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Id:</strong> A digital device Id in MOSIP would be a signed JSON (RFC 7515) as follows:</p>
<pre><code>{
    “serialNo”: &quot;Serial number&quot;,

    “make”: &quot;Make of the device&quot;,

    “model” : &quot;Model of the device&quot;,

    “type”: [“Fingerprint”, “Iris”, “Face&quot;], //More types will be added.

    “subType”: &quot;subtypes of the biometric device&quot;,

    “deviceProvider”: &quot;Device provider name&quot;,

    “deviceProviderId”: &quot;Device provider Id&quot;,

    “dateTime”: &quot;Datetime in ISO format with timezone.  Identity request time&quot;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Signed with the JSON Web Signature (RFC 7515) using the “Foundational Trust Module” Identity key, this data is the fundamental identity of the device.  Every MOSIP compliant device will need the foundational trust module. </p>
<p>The only exception to this rule is for the devices that have the purpose (explained below during device registration)  as "Registration". Those devices are called as L0 where there is not FTM. These devices would sign the request with device key.</p>
<p>Signed Digital Id would look as follows.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;digitalId&quot;: &quot;base64urlencoded(header).base64urlencoded(payload).base64urlencoded(signature)&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Unsigned digital Id would look as follows.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;digitalId&quot;: &quot;base64urlencoded(payload)&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>payload is the Digital ID json object.</p>
<p><strong>Accepted Values</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>    serialNo - Same as the Physical Id

    make - Brand name

    model - Model of the device

    type - [“Fingerprint”, “Iris”, “Face’’], //More types will be added.

    subType - subtype is based on the type.

    Finger - “Slab”, “Single”, “Touchless”

                Iris - “Single”, “Double”,

               Face - Full face

    deviceProvider - Device provider name, This would be a legal entity in the country,

    deviceProviderId: Device provider Id issued by MOSIP

    dateTime:  ISO format with timezone.  Identity request time

<hr />
<h2 id="5-device-service-communication-interfaces">5. Device Service - Communication Interfaces</h2>
<p>The section explains the necessary details of the biometric device connectivity, accessibility, discoverability and protocols used to build and communicate with the device.</p>
<p>The device should implement only the following set of APIs.  All the API’s are independent of the physical layer and the operating system, with the invocation being different across operating systems. While the operating system names are defined in this spec a similar technology can be used for unspecified operating systems.</p>
<p>It is expected that the device service ensures that the device is connected  locally to the host.</p>
<h3 id="51-device-discovery">5.1 Device Discovery:</h3>
<h4 id="specifications-for-windows-and-linux">Specifications for Windows and Linux</h4>
<p>Device discovery would be used to identify MOSIP compliant devices in a system by the applications. The protocol is designed as simple plug and play with all the necessary abstraction to the specifics.

deviceId - Internal Id to identify the actual biometric device within the device service.

deviceSubId - is the internal Id of the device. For example in case of iris capture, the device can have two modules in a single device, it is possible to address each device with a sub Id so we can identify or command each of it in isolation. Sub Id is a simple index which always starts with 1 and increases sequentially for each sub device present.

<p><strong>Allowed Values:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
env - Allowed values are Staging| Developer| Pre-Production | Production

purpose - Allowed values are Auth| Registration

version - version of the biometric block as specified in the authentication or customer registration specification.

timeout - Max time the app will wait for the capture. Its expected that the api will respond back before timeout with the best frame. All timeouts are in milliseconds

captureTime - time of capture in ISO format with timezone.

domainUri - unique uri per auth providers. This can be used to federate across multiple providers or countries or unions.

transactionId - unqiue Id of the transaction. This is an internal Id to the application thats providing the service. Use different id for every successfull auth. So even if the trnsaction fails after auth we expect this number to be unique.

bio.type -  “FIR” , “IIR”, “Face”

bio.count - number of biometric data that is collected for a given type. The device should validate and ensure that this number is in line with the type of biometric that's captured.

bio.requestedScore - what is the expected quality? Upon reaching the necessary quality the biometric device is expected to auto capture the image.

bio.deviceId - a unique Id per device service. In case a single device handles both face and iris the device Id will identify iris and camera uniquely. In case the Id is sent as 0 then the device is expected to capture biometric from both the devices.

bio.deviceSubId  - a specific device sub Id.  Should be set to 0 if we don't know any specific device sub Id.

bio.previousHash - For the first capture the previousHash is hash of empty utf8 string. From the second capture the previous captures hash (as hex encoded) is used as input. This is used to chain all the captures across modalities so all captures have happened for the same transaction and during the same time period. 

customOpts - If in case the device vendor has additional parameters that they can take and act accordingly then those values can be sent by the application developers to the device service.

<p>The registration client application will send sample API. The sample API’s response will provide the actual biometric data in a digitally signed non encrypted form.   When the Device Registration Capture API is called the frames should not be added to the stream. The device is expected to send the images as well as its extraction values. For e.g. the segmented JPEG image is in the bioValue and the segmented and extracted will fit into the bioExtract.</p>
<p>The requestedScore is in the scale of 1-100.  In case the requestedScore is for all the count as average. So, in cases where you have four fingers the average of all will be considered for capture threshold.</p>

version - version of the biometric block as specified in the registration specification.

timeout - Max time the app will wait for the capture.

captureTime - time of capture in ISO format with timezone.

bio.type - “FMR”,  “FIR” , “IIR”, “Face”

bio.count - number of biometric data that is collected for a given type. The device should validate and ensure this number is in line with the type of biometric that's captured.

bio.exception: “LF_INDEX”, “LF_MIDDLE”, “LF_RING”, “LF_LITTLE”,  “LF_THUMB” “RF_INDEX”, “RF_MIDDLE”, “RF_RING”, “RF_LITTLE”,  “RF_THUMB”, “L_IRIS”, “R_IRIS”. This is an array and all the exceptions are marked. In case of an empty element assume there is no exception.

bio.requestedScore - what is the expected quality? Upon reaching the necessary quality the biometric device is expected to auto capture the image.

bio.deviceId - a unique Id per device service. In case a single device handles both face and iris the device Id will identify iris and camera uniquely. In case the Id is sent as 0 then the device is expected to capture biometric from both the devices.

bio.deviceSubId  - a specific device sub Id.  Should be set to 0 if we don't know any specific device sub Id. In case of Fingerprint/IRIS its 1 for left and 2 for right fingerprint/iris. 3 for thumb/two iris.

bio.previousHash - The previous hash for the image captured by this device per registration. For the first capture (per registration) use the hash of empty string.

<p>The management server has the following objectives.
1. Validate the devices to ensure its a genuine device from the respective device provider. This can be achieved using the device info and the certificates for the Foundational Trust Module.
1. Register the genuine device with the MOSIP device server.
1. Manage/Sync time between the end device the server. The time to be synced should be the only trusted time accepted by the device.
1. Ability to issue commands to the end device for
    1. Key rotation of the end device
    1. De-registration of the device
    1. Collect device info
1. A central repository of all the approved devices from the device provider.
1. Safe storage of keys using HSM FIPS 140-2 Level 3. These keys are used to issue the device certificate upon registration.
The Management Server is created and hosted by the device provider outside of MOSIP software. The communication protocols between the MDS and the Management Server can be decided by the respective device provider. Such communication should be restricted to the above specified interactions only. No transactional information should be sent to this server.</p>
